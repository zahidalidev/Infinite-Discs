      <p>
        Infinite Discs are manufactured by Innova Champion Discs. Each disc is designed and manufactured to fill precise
        niches and needs in every disc golf bag. Most Infinite Discs models are designed for players at all levels,
        while
        some discs will be fine-tuned for the specific demands of experienced throwers. Every run specifies the run
        number
        and includes the total number of discs manufactured. This information helps throwers find consistency and allows
        collectors to know the rarity of their discs.
